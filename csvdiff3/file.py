# Define a custom string type that always evaluates to True when cast
# to boolean.
#
# The core merge logic depends on matching lines with similar keys, so
# key values are a core part of the algorithm.  And it is critical to
# know when a key is present in other files; we use a value of None in
# various places as a key to indicate that a particular key is absent
# in one of the merging files.
#
# But the empty string "" is also a legal key --- it arises whenever
# we have a blank line in an input file, for example.  We treat such
# lines as entirely legal, normal lines: a blank line ("" key) in one
# file should simply match the next blank line in other files.
#
# We will be testing whether lines exist by checking if the relevant
# Key evaluates to True or False, eg. with
#
#   if Key_LCA:
#       ...key is present in the current LCA line...
#
# and we want this to evaluate to True even for the empty string.
#
# So provide an override class for such Keys which always evaluate to
# True in such situations; False will only be returned if the Key is
# None, ie. it is genuinely missing and we have no matching line in
# the given file.
